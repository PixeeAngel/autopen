O2OO

Introduction

O2OO is a (OBD-II compliant) car diagnostic tool. It reads sensor data from a car into an sqlite database. It can dump the measured values, generate graphs of the data and create a spreadsheetfile (tested with Libre Office and Excel 2010). That way you can analyse the behaviour of your car. O2OO can also produce a PDF-file with more indept data. This program should work with all cars made after 1996 (US) or 2001 (EU).
O2OO can also retrieve the location from a GPS module and store it in the same database. It then can create a Google Maps KML-file, coloring the route-line with a color depending on a sensor-reading.

Also future versions will do some crude analysis of the data as well (got suggestions for that? contact me!)

For O2OO to run you need an ELM327 adapter (which interfaces the CAN-bus of your vehicle to something a laptop understands enabling it to execute OBD2 commands). For GPS you need, of course a GPS which outputs standard NMEA "sentences" on a serial/usb/etc. port.
