Kayak is an application for CAN bus diagnosis and monitoring. Its main goals are a simple interface and platform independence. It is implemented in pure Java and has no platform specific dependencies. Kayak is based on SocketCAN and the connection to a SocketCAN bus takes place using TCP/IP and a socketcand server. Therefore the bus access is network transparent and can be shared with multiple users.
