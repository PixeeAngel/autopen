The CANBadger has been developed to make car hacking easier and faster. At that point of time, existing tools were expensive and a lot of tools turned out to require a lot of configuration or modification. So instead, we wanted to make a cheap, open-source tool that anybody can afford, while enabling new attacks such as Man-in-the-Middle of live CAN traffic and the diagnostics security hijack. Furthermore, we wanted a tool that can run standalone, not yet another interface. The CANBadger consists of both hardware and software. The main interface is a LPC1768/LPC1769 processor mounted on a custom PCB, which offers two CAN interfaces, SD Card, a blinky LED, some GPIO pins, power supply for peripherals and the ethernet port. With the CANBadger Server, you can even control multiple ethernet-connected CANBadgers from your computer.
