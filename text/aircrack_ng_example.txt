Aircrack-ng Newbie Guide for Linux
Idea and initial work: ASPj
Edited By: the AutoPen Team

Prerequisite: A Wi-Fi adapter with monitor mode capability

To put your wireless card into monitor mode:
airmon-ng start rausb0

To look out for networks:
airodump-ng rausb0

BSSID	The MAC address of the AP
PWR	Signal strength. Some drivers don't report it
Beacons	Number of beacon frames received. If you don't have a signal strength you can estimate it by the number of beacons: the more beacons, the better the signal quality
Data	Number of data frames received
CH	Channel the AP is operating on
MB	Speed or AP Mode. 11 is pure 802.11b, 54 pure 802.11g. Values between are a mixture
ENC	Encryption: OPN: no encryption, WEP: WEP encryption, WPA: WPA or WPA2 encryption, WEP?: WEP or WPA (don't know yet)
ESSID	The network name. Sometimes hidden
Packets	Number of data frames received
Probes	Network names (ESSIDs) this client has probed

To sniff a specific channel (-c) at a specific bssid (--bssid) and write to a file (-w):
airodump-ng -c 11 --bssid 00:01:02:03:04:05 -w dump rausb0

To crack a WEP key (given 40,000+ IVs from the written dump file in the last command):
aircrack-ng -b 00:01:02:03:04:05 dump-01.cap

For Packet Injection
Connecting to your AP (Access Point/AKA Router):
aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -e "your network ESSID" -a 00:01:02:03:04:05 rausb0

If it works, you shoud see the following:
12:14:06  Sending Authentication Request
12:14:06  Authentication successful
12:14:06  Sending Association Request
12:14:07  Association successful :-)
