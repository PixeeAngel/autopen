Bluelog is a Linux Bluetooth scanner with optional daemon mode and web front-end, designed for site surveys and traffic monitoring. Itâ€™s intended to be run for long periods of time in a static location to determine how many discoverable Bluetooth devices there are in the area.

The following is a brief description of the commands used in BlueLog. These attributes, when using BlueLog, will allow you to have greater granularity of control over the functionality of the tool.



    -i <interface>     Sets scanning device, default is "hci0"
    -o <filename>      Sets output filename, default is "devices.log"
    -v                 Verbose, prints discovered devices to the terminal
    -q                 Quiet, turns off nonessential terminal outout
    -d                 Enables daemon mode, Bluelog will run in background
    -k                 Kill an already running Blue log process
    -l                 Start "Blue log Live", default is disabled

Logging Options:
    -n                 Write device names to log, default is disabled
    -m                 Write device manufacturer to log, default is disabled
    -c                 Write device class to log, default is disabled
    -f                 Use "friendly" device class, default is disabled
    -t                 Write timestamps to log, default is disabled
    -x                 Obfuscate discovered MACs, default is disabled
    -e                 Encode discovered MACs with CRC32, default disabled
    -b                 Enable BlueProPro log format, see README

Advanced Options:
    -r <retries>       Name resolution retries, default is 3
    -a <minutes>       Amnesia, Blue log will forget device after given time
    -w <seconds>       Scanning window in seconds, see README
    -s                 Syslog only mode, no log file. Default is disabled
    
    
    The following is a brief example of how BlueLog might be used. The machine on which it is being used must have a bluetooth module, and it must be enabled.
