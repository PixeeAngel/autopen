BlueZ provides support for the core Bluetooth layers and protocols. It is flexible, efficient and uses a modular implementation. It has many interesting features:

Features:
	Complete modular implementation
	Symmetric multi processing safe
	Multithreaded data processing
	Support for multiple Bluetooth devices
	Real hardware abstraction
	Standard socket interface to all layers
	Device and service level security support

Currently BlueZ consists of many separate modules:
	Bluetooth kernel subsystem core
	L2CAP and SCO audio kernel layers
	RFCOMM, BNEP, CMTP and HIDP kernel implementations
	HCI UART, USB, PCMCIA and virtual device drivers
	General Bluetooth and SDP libraries and daemons
	Configuration and testing utilities
	Protocol decoding and analysis tools

Platforms:
The BlueZ kernel modules, libraries and utilities are known to be working perfect on many architectures supported by Linux. This also includes single and multi processor platforms as well as hyper threading systems:

	Intel and AMD x86
	AMD64 and EM64T (x86-64)
	SUN SPARC 32/64bit
	PowerPC 32/64bit
	Intel StrongARM and XScale
	Hitachi/Renesas SH processors
	Motorola DragonBall


Distributions:
Support for BlueZ can be found in many Linux distributions and in general it is compatible with any Linux system on the market:

	Debian GNU/Linux
	Ubuntu Linux
	Fedora Core / Red Hat Linux
	OpenSuSE / SuSE Linux
	Mandrake Linux
	Gentoo Linux
	Chrome OS
